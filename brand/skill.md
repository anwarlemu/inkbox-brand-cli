description: Build or restyle interfaces with the {{brand}} design system. Use when the project uses {{bin}} or the user requests {{brand}} components, tokens, or visual styling.
---

Use the project's configured components and brand tokens. Preserve the user's requested content and behavior.

Read project context with `npx {{bin}} info --json`. It reports the framework, stylesheet, aliases, installed components and registry. If the CLI is missing, use `npx -y {{source}}` in its place.

Find suitable components with `search <term> --json`, then read `view <names...> --json`. The response contains exact source and working examples. Inspect variant names, callback signatures and example dependencies instead of assuming another library's API.

Install with `add <names...> --dry-run --json`, then `add <names...> --json`. Existing local files are preserved. Use `add <names...> --diff` to compare updates; use `--overwrite` only when replacing those local changes is intended.

For new applications, `create --template vite --name <directory>` scaffolds the framework and installs the brand. Existing applications use `init`. Use `apply --dry-run` only when the user requests conversion of existing styles; package installation and restyling are different operations.

Read `guide` for brand rules and `tokens <term> --json` for custom styling. Keep colors scoped to component roles; preserve artwork, chart data and unrelated palettes. Use `check --json` and the application's build and interaction tests to verify the result.

The standard shadcn registry is `{{registry}}/r/shadcn/{name}.json`, under `@{{bin}}` in components.json. Use `npx shadcn@4.22.1 add @{{bin}}/theme @{{bin}}/<name>` for shadcn's workspace routing and ecosystem integrations. The same registry works with its MCP server. Component references are at `{{registry}}/components`.

With the upstream installer, include the theme explicitly so existing shadcn font and color aliases are updated. Native add applies it automatically.
